# Loop Functions
* For & while loops are useful when programming but not when working interactively on the 
  command line; there are some functions which implement looping to make life easier
  * lapply: Loop over a list and evaluate function on each element
  * sapply: Same as lapply but simplify the result
  * tapply: Apply function over vector subsets
  * mapply: Multivariate version of lapply
* Aux function split() also useful in conjuction with lapply
